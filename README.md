must download all files to play Breakout!

Losing a life and its consequences:
- you lose a life by letting the ball hit the bottom edge of the display
- if you still have a life left, a new ball respawns and...
     - you lose 10 points for losing a ball

Breaking a brick and its results:
- the bricks are the rainbow colored rows of rectangles at the top of the screen
- you "break a brick" by making the ball hit a brick
     - which lets the ball bounce off and....
     - you gain 1 point!

Win condition:
- you successfully broke all the bricks, regardless of how many points you have 
     - (but doesn't it feel nice to have the highest score?)

Lose condition:
- you lost all your lives :(
